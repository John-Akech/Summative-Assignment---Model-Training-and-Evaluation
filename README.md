README: Neural Network Optimization and Model Comparison

Problem Statement

I developed this project to optimize a Neural Network and compare its performance against Machine Learning algorithms. My goal was to identify the best-performing model for classification using different hyperparameter configurations. I experimented with various optimizers, regularization techniques, and early stopping mechanisms to improve performance. The dataset used consists of labeled instances for multi-class classification.

Findings

Below is a summary of different training instances with their respective configurations and results:

| Training Instance | Optimizer | Regularizer (L1/L2) | Epochs | Early Stopping | Layers | Learning Rate | Accuracy | Loss | F1 Score | Precision | Recall | ROC AUC Score |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|--------|----------------|--------|---------------|----------|------|----------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Instance 1        | Default   | None                | 50     | No             | 3      | Default       | 0.9736   | --   | 0.9595   | 0.9816    | 0.9383 | 0.9951        |
| Instance 2        | Adam      | L2 (0.01)           | 100    | Yes            | 4      | 0.001         | 0.9795   | --   | 0.9685   | 0.9908    | 0.9471 | 0.9983        |
| Instance 3        | RMSProp   | L1 (0.001)          | 120    | Yes            | 5      | 0.0005        | 0.9663   | --   | 0.9483   | 0.9679    | 0.9295 | 0.9952        |
| Instance 4        | Adam      | L2 (0.005)          | 80     | No             | 4      | 0.001         | 0.9677   | --   | 0.9500   | 0.9812    | 0.9207 | 0.9958        |
| Instance 5        | Adam      | L1 & L2 (0.001)     | 150    | Yes            | 6      | 0.0001        | 0.9809   | --   | 0.9713   | 0.9735    | 0.9692 | 0.9984        |

Summary

From my experiments, the best combination was found in Instance 5, which used the Adam optimizer with both L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and a learning rate of 0.0001. This configuration achieved the highest accuracy (0.9809) and the best F1-score (0.9713).

ML Algorithm vs. Neural Network

I also compared the performance of my optimized Neural Network against traditional Machine Learning models:

## ML Algorithm vs. Neural Network

I also compared the performance of my optimized Neural Network against traditional Machine Learning models:

| Model                   | Accuracy     | F1 Score     | Precision     | Recall      | ROC AUC      |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Random Forest           | 0.9266       | 0.8837       | 0.9359        | 0.8370      | 0.9831       |
| XGBoost                 | 0.9428       | 0.9099       | 0.9563        | 0.8678      | 0.9872       |
| Logistic Regression     | 0.9897       | 0.9843       | 1.0000        | 0.9691      | 0.9997       |
| **Best Neural Network** | **0.9809**   | **0.9713**   | **0.9734**    | **0.9691**  | **0.9984**   |


Interestingly, Logistic Regression outperformed my Neural Network, achieving the highest accuracy and ROC AUC score. This suggests that for this dataset, a simpler model with well-tuned hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength, solver type) may generalize better than a deep neural network.

Next Steps

Further optimize the Neural Network by fine-tuning dropout rates and batch normalization.

Try ensemble techniques to combine Neural Networks with traditional ML models.

Experiment with additional architectures such as CNNs or Transformers if applicable.

Deploy the best model and create an API for real-world predictions.
